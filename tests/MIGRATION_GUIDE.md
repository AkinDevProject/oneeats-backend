# E2E Tests Migration Guide

## 🔄 Migration from Legacy to Professional Structure

This guide documents the migration from the original test structure to the new professional organization.

## 📋 Migration Summary

### ✅ Completed Changes

#### 1. **Directory Restructure**
```
Old Structure:                    New Structure:
tests/specs/                     tests/specs/
├── phase1-dashboard.spec.ts     ├── restaurant/
├── dashboard-ui.spec.ts         │   ├── authentication.spec.ts
├── phase2-api.spec.ts           │   ├── menu-management.spec.ts
├── phase3-orders.spec.ts        │   ├── order-management.spec.ts
└── integration-complete.spec.ts │   ├── restaurant-settings.spec.ts
                                 │   └── dashboard-responsive.spec.ts
                                 ├── api/
                                 │   ├── restaurant-api.spec.ts
                                 │   └── menu-api.spec.ts
                                 └── integration/
                                     └── end-to-end-workflows.spec.ts
```

#### 2. **Professional Naming Convention**
- **Files**: `kebab-case.spec.ts` instead of `phase1-dashboard.spec.ts`
- **Tests**: `should [action] when [condition]` instead of `Test 1.1 : Action`
- **Descriptions**: Business-focused feature names instead of technical phase numbers

#### 3. **Enhanced Documentation**
- **JSDoc Headers**: Complete file documentation with author, version, coverage
- **Inline Comments**: Professional, clear explanations of test logic
- **README**: Comprehensive guide with examples and best practices

#### 4. **Improved Test Organization**
- **Grouped by Feature**: Authentication, menu management, orders, settings
- **Nested Describes**: Logical grouping of related test scenarios
- **Clear Test Data**: Centralized, well-structured test fixtures

## 🚀 Running New Tests

### **Individual Test Suites**
```bash
# Authentication tests
npx playwright test restaurant/authentication.spec.ts

# Menu management tests  
npx playwright test restaurant/menu-management.spec.ts

# Order management tests
npx playwright test restaurant/order-management.spec.ts

# Settings tests
npx playwright test restaurant/restaurant-settings.spec.ts

# Responsive design tests
npx playwright test restaurant/dashboard-responsive.spec.ts
```

### **All Restaurant Tests**
```bash
# Run complete restaurant dashboard test suite
npx playwright test restaurant/

# With browser visible
npx playwright test restaurant/ --headed

# Specific browser
npx playwright test restaurant/ --project=chromium
```

### **Legacy Tests (Temporary)**
```bash
# Run old tests during transition period
npx playwright test --project=legacy-tests
```
